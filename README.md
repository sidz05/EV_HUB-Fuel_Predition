# Vehicle Machine Learning Application

This is a Streamlit-based web application for vehicle-related machine learning predictions.

## Features

- Load trained machine learning models (.pkl files)
- Make predictions using uploaded models
- View model performance comparisons

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`

## File Structure

```
ml-vehicle-app/
├── best_model.pkl              # Trained model (to be added)
├── requirements.txt            # Package dependencies
├── model_comparison.png        # Model comparison plot (optional)
├── app.py                      # Streamlit application
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Upload your trained model file in the sidebar
3. Use the interface to make predictions
